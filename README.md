# TASK-1
DATA CLEANING AND DATA PREPROCESSING USING NETFLIX DATASET:

Data cleaning is the process of identifying and correcting (or removing) errors, inconsistencies, or inaccuracies in a dataset.
It ensures the data is:
1.Accurate
2.Complete
3.Reliable
4.Consistent
Data preprocessing is a broader step that prepares raw data for machine learning or analysis.
This task demonstrates data cleaning using a sample Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset.

## Cleaning Steps:
1. Uploaded dataset in Google Colab
2. Identified and handled missing values
3. Removed duplicate rows
4. Standardized text values (e.g., gender, country)
5. Converted inconsistent date formats to dd-mm-yyyy
6. Cleaned column headers and fixed data types

## Tools Used:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Google Colab
- Excel
- GitHub
